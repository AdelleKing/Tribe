<!-- Hero image - the hero image was created in canva. I did originally have text overlaying the image but found it needed a shadow to show the text better but this shadow was wider than the image itself. And creating the same effect in canva did not yeild the same results so a design choice was made to remove the text from the hero image. -->

 <!--August Highlights-  This is the focal point of the website, the african tribal print. This print was pivital to the design to represent the community the site is intended for.
